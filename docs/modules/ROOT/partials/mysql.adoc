== About

[NOTE]
====
"*_MySQL_* is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of '*My*', the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and '*SQL*', the abbreviation for Structured Query Language."

Normally, a *MySQL* instance is running in 3306 port, so to validate if it is working, it is enough to open a telnet session.

[TIP]
====
In order to make the telnet session, here is a link to a document that explains how to do effectively.

It is advised to do the telnet connection test and also to validate that the *IP* or *DNS* defined for the
*_MySQL_* instance per environment is being referenced in the health check where this is used. *_Cruise Booking Service_* uses it.
